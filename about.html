            I've always liked surfing the web, going through its nooks and
            crannies. I hope whoever arrives at my site enjoys
            <em>surfing</em> it too!

            I'm an aspiring creative technologist who studied Data Science and
            Interactive Tech at Cornell. Currently spending postgrad as a
            product designer @ Atlassian in NYC but mostly tinkering with
            graphic design, illustration, and trying my hand with new media
            tools.

            I love meeting new people and communities - please shoot me a
            message at cliu55567@gmail.com!
