      Throughout my life I’ve always identified as an “artist”, whether it
      manifested as scribbling comics in my elementary school journal to writing
      verbose nanowrimo stories with my friend to recording anime speedpaints to
      hacking together a last minute art portfolio for college; I was always
      drawn to this spirit of creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But despite all that, I always hesitated when calling myself an “artist”.
      Back in high school, I had felt like it was something that needed to be
      proven. Every time I picked up the pen, I would fall into the trap of
      evaluating the meaning of my work based on the outcome. How many likes did
      it get? How many notes? How many people saw it? If no one saw it, did it
      even happen? If I had poured hours into a piece for it to be consumed in a
      second, did it even mean anything?
    </p>
    <p>
      In an effort to get more views and likes I’d try and pander to whatever
      was popular in culture. If a show had just ended, I’d draw fanart of it.
      If I drew a girl, I’d tag #blackpink (even if there was no relation). I
      saw those quick drawings as necessary means to an end where I would have
      enough followers to break through the algorithm and finally, I could just
      draw whatever I wanted and have it be seen. Because of the sheer wealth of
      content
      <a href="https://thenewinquiry.com/athletic-aesthetics/">competing</a> for
      attention, I was outputting work, not for self-expression, but in hopes
      one post would become my lucky golden ticket to becoming known.

    <p>
      And so at the end of all that, I stopped really drawing. I wasn’t drawing
      for myself or of myself.
    </p>
    <img src="/image/b2.webp" style="width: 400px; height: auto" />
    <p>
      Instead, I was drawing myself into what I thought would cater to other’s
      tastes.
    </p>
    <img src="/image/b3.webp" style="width: 400px; height: auto" />

    <p>
      So now, years later, why do I create? What does that mean to me now? What
      am I doing differently?
    </p>
    <p>
      I make art, first and foremost, for myself. That way, no matter the
      outcome, if no one in the world sees it, if no one thinks much of it, if
      no one likes it, it will have been worth it. Self-expression for me is a
      way to formalize my vision of how I want to live in the world. It’s a way
      for me to make my values and dreams more real through processing my lived
      experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      I still make art for others, not to cater to people’s tastes but rather as
      a form of connection. We remember art that makes us feel seen and that
      helps us know how to live. I don’t cry easily, but I cry when I hear
      Mitski sing Star on stage and I cry reading this
      <a href="https://pudding.cool/2021/03/love-and-ai/">article</a> about love
      and I cry playing this game where someone is
      <a href="https://haraiva.itch.io/under-a-star-called-sun">lost</a> in
      space. Maybe that’s why people love participatory art projects, where
      people respond on a piece of paper to a
      <a href="https://strangersproject.com/">prompt</a>. And when all those
      stories are all around you, you realize maybe you aren’t alone after all.
      And if one person could relate to my work, that would have been more than
      enough.

    <p>
      And in the end, my art, a record of the people and versions of myself that
      I’ve met, is a part of my existence that will never go away.
