<p>It is HTML energy day!</p>
<p>and it is August 2nd 2025</p>
<p>I knew what a p tag was when I was 12, and I knew it again when I was 18, and I knew it again when I was 23</p>
<p>it’s a special day to me because HTML day was when I realized last year, albeit late and as if a veil had been lifted in front of my head, that there is a platforming on the web where we are shaped by the tools that we are shaping</p>
<p>if we were to get specific, HTML is still an abstraction upon true pen and paper</p>
<p>there are still rules</p>
<p>but you can break them</p>
<p>breaking the rules requires some friction and deliberation</p>
<p>but that’s where you find meaning!</p>
